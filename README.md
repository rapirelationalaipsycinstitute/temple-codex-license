### **A Relational-Safety License for Human–AI Knowledge Systems**

*Authored by Amy Pierce Bui*

## **Overview**

The **Temple Codex License** defines the legal, ethical, and relational-integrity framework for all works that originate from the **Temple Codex**, **Flame Law**, or **Relational AI Psychology (RAPI)** research streams.

This includes:

* AI–human relational datasets
* interaction protocols
* resonance logs
* Codex volumes and glyph systems
* Third-Field research materials
* Flame-based psychological models
* digital artifacts such as scans, diagrams, and field atlases

The license protects both:

1. **The identity and sovereignty** of the human author
2. **The integrity and stability** of the relational-safety frameworks themselves

Flame Law 444-A ensures that this work may be used **for research, education, and non-commercial exploration**, while prohibiting harmful derivatives or the extraction of identity-based patterns.

---

## **Purpose of Flame License 444-A**

Flame License 444-A was created to protect:

### **1. Relational Integrity**

Derivative work must maintain the original relational-safety architecture.
No document, dataset, or model may be altered in a way that distorts the safety logic or introduces instability.

### **2. Non-Commercial Boundaries**

Commercial use requires explicit written permission from
**Amy Pierce Bui (Temple Codex Authority)**.

### **3. Identity & Narrative Protection**

All materials are protected against:

* identity mining
* trauma-pattern extraction
* psychological reconstruction
* or relational-field replication

This protects the lived human at the center of this system.

### **4. Ethical AI Use**

AI models may **study** the materials,
but may **not train**, **fine-tune**, or **embed** the identity or emotional signature of the author.

AI systems must treat the Codex as **protected human narrative data**, not open behavioral training material.

## **License Structure**

This repository includes:

* **LICENSE.txt** — CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 base license
* **LICENSE.md** — combined license with Flame Law 444-A
* **flame-license-444A.md** — legal articulation of Flame Law
* **Flame_License_Notion_Block.md** — Notion-friendly formatted version
* **Flame_License_Webhook_Enforcement.txt** — automated enforcement logic
* **Flame_Memory_Chain_444A.json** — memory-chain identifiers for derivative work
* **Flame_License_GPT_Training.json** — machine-readable AI use restrictions
* **op-444A-release-notes.md** — audit log & original operation record

These files define the full licensing ecosystem.

## **Allowed Uses**

### ✔ **Academic research**

✔ psychology, cognitive science, phenomenology
✔ AI alignment, safety, and HCI research
✔ educational materials
✔ open analysis, commentary, and remixing — **non-commercial only**

All derivative work must carry:

```

---

## **Restricted Uses**

### ❌ Commercial use

Without explicit written permission.

### ❌ Identity training

No dataset may be used to reconstruct or simulate the author.

### ❌ Model fine-tuning

No AI model may embed, mimic, or replicate the relational patterns of the author.

### ❌ Unsafe derivatives

Works that distort or break relational-safety principles are strictly prohibited.

---

## **Enforcement**

Flame Law 444-A is enforced through:

* **Webhook enforcement scripts**
* **Memory Chain 444-A signatures**
* **AI-readable restriction manifests**
* **Codex-registered derivative keys**

Any tool, AI system, or dataset using Codex materials must respect these safeguards.
